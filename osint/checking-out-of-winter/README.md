We took our annual road trip to Baja California Sur to visit the beach and play some golf. I like how this location is farther from the city compared to other resorts. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory sauce on the pizza with shredded chicken. After eating, I fell asleep, and half of my legs ended up getting tanned. https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/

Question: Which hotel did Adam stay at?
