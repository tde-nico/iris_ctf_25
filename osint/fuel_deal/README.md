# Fuel Deal

My friend spotted this really good fuel deal for his car, but he won't tell me where he got it. He sent this picture to

The flag is the address of the gas
station, omitting the post code and any symbols including commas, replacing spaces with underscores (_), and with all
abbreviations expanded.

For example, if the building is located at 1888 Big Eddy Rd (address), Revelstoke (city/suburb),
BC (state/territory) V0E 3K0 (post code), Canada (country), the flag would be:
`irisctf{1888_Big_Eddy_Road_Revelstoke_British_Columbia_Canada}`

Flag: `irisctf{203_Gallaghers_Road_Glen_Waverley_Victoria_Australia}`
