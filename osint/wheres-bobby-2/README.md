I took this picture while I was on a trip, somewhere, and I saw this beautiful wall art.
&nbsp;
However, in a shocking turn of events, I don't know where it was! Can you find it for me?
&nbsp;
The flag is the coordinates of the building which contains this wall art, in decimal format and correct to 4 decimal places, and seperated by an underscore (_).
&nbsp;
For example, if the building was located at `50°59'52.934"N, 118°13'28.792"W` the flag would be `irisctf{50.9980_-118.2247}`.

Flag: `irisctf{39.8914_116.4917}`
