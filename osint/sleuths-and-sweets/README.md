I visited my friend in Japan, and we had some alright crepes! The area had a lot of foot traffic, so we expected a long wait, but it was worth it. I’m usually not a fan of yogurt in my crepe, but it still tasted pretty alright. https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/

Question: What is the address of this location?
