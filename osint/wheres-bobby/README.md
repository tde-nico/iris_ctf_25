I took this picture while I was on a road trip. I distinctively remember that there was a body of water along this route, and there weren't many populated areas.
Find the route number of the road I was on.
&nbsp;
The flag is the route number and the 2-character abbreviation of the country it is in, seperated by an underscore (_). For example, if the route was route 23 in British Columbia, Canada, the flag would be `irisctf{23_CA}`.

Flag: `irisctf{S3801_CN}`
